# TimeCube

## 1.Overview
Our goal is to create an Android application that allows us to assign a dedicated wall from TimeCube to dedicated timer. Application is dedicated to developers that needs tracking time.

## 2.Description
For transfering the data from STM32 to Android we use HC-05 Bluetooth.
Implementation based on UART.

## 3.Tools
For our project we use STM32F407 microcontroller featuring 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4F core. We build an Android application in Android Studio.

## 4.How to run
To run the project make sure you got:
-STM32F4-DISCOVERY board,
-Bluetooth HC-05 module 

## 5.How to compile
Import project to WorkBench.

## 6.Future improvements
- Write an task container in android application.
